# Writing Updates (aka Migrations)

Sometimes when a new version of Matomo is released, it's necessary to make changes to the database or filesystem.
Matomo accomplishes this through the auto update process via individual `Update` classes that contain the logic to
upgrade a Matomo from one version to another. (In other frameworks and libraries these are called "migrations".)

This document explains how to create Updates both in Matomo core and in plugins.

## Creating a new Update

Core updates are stored in the `core/Updates` directory. The filename should match the version the Update upgrades to,
for example, `4.0.1-b1.php`. Inside, the class name should replace non-alphanumeric characters with underscores: `Updates_4_0_1_b1`.

The basic structure of an Update class is:

```php
<?php
class Updates_4_3_0_b3 extends PiwikUpdates
{
    /**
     * @var MigrationFactory
     */
    private $migration;

    public function __construct(MigrationFactory $factory)
    {
        $this->migration = $factory;
    }

    public function getMigrations(Updater $updater)
    {
        // many different migrations are available to be used via $this->migration factory
        $migration1 = $this->migration->db->changeColumnType('log_visit', 'example', 'BOOLEAN NOT NULL');
        // you can also define custom SQL migrations. If you need to bind parameters, use `->boundSql()`
        $migration2 = $this->migration->db->sql($sqlQuery = 'SELECT 1');

        return array(
            // $migration1,
            // $migration2
        );
    }

    public function doUpdate(Updater $updater)
    {
        $updater->executeMigrations(__FILE__, $this->getMigrations($updater));
    }
}
```

The `getMigrations()` method returns explicit step by step changes to make to the system. Separating them like
this allows us to display the list of changes that will be made to the user in case the user would like to do
them manually, one at a time (useful for large instances).

In this method you can use the `MigrationFactory` class (which is set in the constructor of an `Update`) to create
lists of individual migrations that should be run in this `Update`. Matomo ships with a set of predefined `Migrations`
for common things like changing an INI config value, deleting or activating a plugin, creating database tables or
changing database table columns. Read more about them in the PHP docs for the individual factory classes:

* [DB migrations](https://developer.matomo.org/api-reference/Piwik/Updater/Migration/Db/Factory)
* [Plugin migrations](https://developer.matomo.org/api-reference/Piwik/Updater/Migration/Plugin/Factory)
* [Config migrations](https://developer.matomo.org/api-reference/Piwik/Updater/Migration/Config/Factory)

The `doUpdate()` method performs the entire update. It must call `$updater->executeMigrations(...)` as above if there are
individual migrations defined. It can also include other update logic that doesn't have an associated migration,
but it is encouraged to find some way to put them in a migration, since otherwise the user wouldn't be able
to apply them manually.

If you do create a custom migration, it is required that you make it **idempotent**. That is to say, running the
update multiple times should change the system only once and should not result in an error.

**Steps to creating a new Update**

To create a new Update class, do the following:

1. Check the version in core/Version.php, and bump it. If it's set to `4.0.0`, for example, set it to `4.0.0-b1`. If it's set to `4.0.0-b1`, set it to `4.0.0-b2`.
   If it's set to `4.0.0-rc1`, set it to `4.0.0-rc2`. The version you bump it to must always be a beta or release candidate version, since the product
   owner is the only one who releases whole new versions.
2. Run the `./console generate:update` command and specify `core`.
3. In the `core/Updates` folder there will now be a new Update with the version you bumped Version.php to. Fill it with the update
   logic you need.

## How Updates Are Run

On every request Matomo will check if the current version of Matomo (stored in the `version_core` option) is less than the version hardcoded in Version.php.
If this is true, then the code was updated, but not the database. This triggers the database update workflow.

The update workflow looks for every update file in the `Updates` folder that has a version greater than the current version and less than or equal to the version in Version.php (using `version_compare()`). It runs each in order, one after the other. Once done, the `version_core` option is updated.

The updater will also automatically make changes to tracking dimensions if their definition changes.

## Merging an Update

Sometimes it can take a while before a pull request is ready to merge. It's possible other pull requests with
updates were merged in the meantime, bumping the version each time. So when the original pull request is ready
to merge, the version bump there may no longer be to a new version.

Since every Update requires a change to the Version.php file, this will result in a merge conflict visible in GitHub.
To resolve it, simply change the version to the new next version in both Version.php and the new Update file you added.

## Differences with the Migration pattern

Some of this may sound familiar to you if you're aware of the Migration pattern. If so, you'll also note there
are some key differences:

* The migrations are tied to a specific Matomo version. Which means every time you need to create an update, the version has to
  be bumped. In practice this isn't a problem since we bump to betas and release candidates, but it can be annoying.
* There is no way to downgrade an Update. This means Matomo downgrades must be done manually. It also means the logic
  to downgrade is not described anywhere.

# Updates for Plugins

Plugins can include their own updates as well. The only real difference between core updates is where plugin updates are placed.
Plugin updates are placed in the `plugins/{PluginName}/Updates` folders and can be generated via the `generate:update`
command.

The only other difference in the workflow for creating an Update for a plugin is where the plugin version is stored, which is
the `plugin.json` file.

# Dimension Column Management

Dimension column types are defined within the individual Dimension types themselves, for example: [https://github.com/matomo-org/matomo/blob/4.x-dev/plugins/DevicesDetection/Columns/DeviceBrand.php#L21](https://github.com/matomo-org/matomo/blob/4.x-dev/plugins/DevicesDetection/Columns/DeviceBrand.php#L21).

The creation and updating of dimension columns in log tables is handled automatically by the updater. When the column
is created, we create an entry in the `option` table with a name like `version_log_table.dimension_column_name` for the column
with the value set to the column type, which is how we can tell if we need to change it.

If we see a column that already has a version, and the column type in the `option` table is different from the dimension
PHP file, we know we need to update it.
